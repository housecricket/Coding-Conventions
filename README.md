Quantum Leaps C/C++ Coding Standard

The following coding guidelines are intended to improve code portability, readability, uniformity, and maintainability for software. The primary objective of this Coding Standard is to boost software productivity and lower maintenance costs by promoting commonality and avoiding misinterpretations and guessing.

C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions

The use of a guide or set of conventions gives programmers a set of rules for code normalization or coding style that establishes how to format code, name variables, place comments or any other non language dependent structural decision that is used on the code. This is very important, as you share a project with others. Agreeing to a common set of coding standards and recommendations saves time and effort, by enabling a greater understanding and transparency of the code base, providing a common ground for undocumented structures, making for easy debugging, and increasing code maintainability.

Google’s C++ Style Guide

The goal of this guide is to manage this complexity by describing in detail the dos and don’ts of writing C++ code . These rules exist to keep the code base manageable while still allowing coders to use C++ language features productively.

C# Programming Language
C# Coding Conventions (C# Programming Guide)

Coding conventions serve the following purposes:

    They create a consistent look to the code, so that readers can focus on content, not layout.
    They enable readers to understand the code more quickly by making assumptions based on previous experience.
    They facilitate copying, changing, and maintaining the code.
    They demonstrate C# best practices.
